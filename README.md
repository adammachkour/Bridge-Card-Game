# Bridge Card Game 

</h>Simulated a Bridge Game using mutiple ADTs</h>

From chapter 2 of the textbook **Data Structures and Algorithms Using Python and C++, by David M. Reed and John Zell** 

Used:
* Given Hand class which implements a hand of a player from a standard 52 card deck
* Given Card class which implements a card of a standard 52 card deck
* Given Deck class which implements a standard 52 card deck
* Given TestDeck UnitTest to test the Deck class

Implemented:
* Edited the TestDeck UnitTest to make output appear clear and clean
* TestCard file: UnitTest to test the Card class 
* shuffle, addTop, addBottom, and addRandom functions of the Deck Class
* Bridge Game which imports the Hand, Card, and Deck classes to run a simulation of the Bridge Card Game

 	
## Prerequisites

* Python3 installed

## Built With

* Python

## How to Run
* To run the UnitTest, you may run either TestCard or TestDeck
